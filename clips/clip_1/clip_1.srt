1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,200
Why is it not working?

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,160
What's wrong with it?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,560
Okay, I'm a researcher, of course. I'm going to restart the clip.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,880
Okay. Wait, wait, let's just let's just wait.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,900
Okay, now it's working.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,520
Okay. Hi, I think yours wasn't working.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,900
Yeah, reload the page, reload the page.

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,800
Did you get timed out?

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,720
No. What's happening, mate? I was stopping the clip.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,860
I don't see any of it on my screen.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,880
I don't see any of your messages.

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,560
Yes, now you got shuttle bundles. Shall we go to the solution?

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,000
No, no, I just reloaded the page, I think.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,120
Okay. I'm going to start recording?

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,020
Yeah. Okay.

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,620
See you now. Let's just hear it, let's just hear it out. I start streaming, start streaming.

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
No, no, no, I don't see it, bro.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,020
All right, I'll go like this.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,820
Dude, I actually don't see it.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,140
I don't see anything.

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,280
Yeah, I don't see anything.

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,940
Buenos días. I got shuttle bundles.

23
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,200
He got banned.

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,220
He got banned, bro.

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,780
Okay, we have 9 minutes to submit for the video.

26
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,040
Okay.

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,920
Three, two, one, go.

29
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,580
Hey guys.

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,240
What's up? Bonsoir.

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:07,440
We're at the AWS Hackathon. We're getting happy. We're getting hyped, right? We're here with the team. We're Brandon right there. We got Gerard. We got Joel, right? And I'm Matthew, right?

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:07,980
Hell yeah.

33
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,040
We got the chatters in the chat right now, right? Those messages, those W's in the chat are going up right now, right?

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,580
In the chat.

35
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:35,280
W's in the chat, right? Those messages per second are rising right now. And there, we just generated our first viral clip, right? Status is recording. It's creating that clip, right? So we should see in a second right here once that chats per second go down from 0.45.
